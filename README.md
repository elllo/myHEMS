my Home Energy Monitoring System for Jolt/Ampair mentorship program. (Nov18-Feb19)

Ampair (formerly known as "Jolt") is a mentorship program by WATTx (https://wattx.io) for people who want to develop their skills in tech. Go to https://ampair.io/ for more info.

This project was done over a period of 3 months with very little programming skills at the beginning. The code does not follow readability and reusability standards. In case of continuation with the project the code base will be entirely overhauled. 

For a general introduction of the project have a look at file "my%HEMSÂ° final presentation clean.pdf"
